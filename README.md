# MASM32-Assembly-Game
### A simple Hero vs Monster game inspired by a previous project of ours and now implementended in Assembly x32

Project developed for our final grade in the TI501 class in the first semester of 2021. It is a re-implmentation of a previous javascript/HTML web-game that we did 2 year prior in our course. The player controls a Hero with the arrow keys and has to keep running away from the monster, whose speed gradualy increases.
